# World-Happiness-Prediction-Project

This project explores the **World Happiness Report 2019** using machine learning techniques to predict happiness scores and classify the top 10 happiest countries. The models include both regression and classification approaches, with performance evaluation and comparison.

## 📁 Contents
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Regression models: Linear Regression, Bayesian Ridge, Gaussian Process, etc.
- Classification models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest
- Top 10 happiest country prediction and comparison
- Visualizations and performance metrics

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is from the [World Happiness Report 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness), which includes features such as:
- GDP per capita
- Social support
- Healthy life expectancy
- Freedom to make life choices
- Generosity
- Perceptions of corruption

## 🧠 Models Used
### Regression
- Linear Regression
- Bayesian Ridge Regression
- Gaussian Process Regression

### Classification
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest

## 🔍 Key Features
- Predict happiness scores from socioeconomic indicators
- Classify whether a country belongs to the top 10 happiest countries
- Compare predicted vs. actual top 10 countries
- Visualize performance with scatter plots, confusion matrices, and evaluation metrics

## 📈 Results Snapshot
- **Bayesian Ridge** performed best among regression models
- **KNN** provided the most accurate classification of top 10 countries
- Successfully predicted all actual top 10 countries

## 📌 Getting Started
